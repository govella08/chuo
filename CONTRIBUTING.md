Hi All.

If find yourself here it means you are trying to see how this cms were made.

I shall start with the package used, I'll assume you are familiar with laravel framework as this cms is using laravel.

The Package used in this cms are:
    1. Waavi/Translation as languages package
    2. LaravelCollective form/html as form builder package
    3. cviebrock/eloquent-sluggable for slugs generation and manipulation

The rest of the cms is unchanged which means the structure of directories.
